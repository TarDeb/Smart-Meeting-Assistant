Project Overview
The Smart Meeting Assistant is an AI-powered application that enhances meeting productivity by:

Automatically transcribing recorded meeting audio.
Summarizing the discussion in concise formats.
Extracting key details, such as action items, dates, and assigned owners.
Integrating with Microsoft Teams to automate processing of recorded meetings.
Presenting transcripts, summaries, and tasks through a React dashboard.
By automating time-consuming tasks like note-taking and task management, this assistant enables teams to focus on strategic discussions rather than administrative overhead.

Goals & Objectives
Boost Efficiency: Eliminate manual note-taking and reduce the effort needed to create meeting summaries.
Improve Accuracy: Provide reliable transcripts and clearly defined action items.
Streamline Workflows: Integrate seamlessly with Microsoft Teams for a frictionless user experience.
Scalability: Handle a growing number of meetings and users without degraded performance.
Scope & Features
Functional Requirements

Entity & Action Item Extraction
Detect named entities (people, dates, organizations, etc.).
Identify tasks, deadlines, and assigned owners from the transcript.
Microsoft Teams Integration
Automatically retrieve meeting recordings through Teams Bot or Microsoft Graph API.

Security & Compliance
Secure APIs (HTTPS, OAuth2 for Teams integration).
Compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) if storing personal data.
Reliability & Availability
Aim for minimal downtime through managed cloud services or Kubernetes.
Maintainability
Clean, well-documented codebase with test coverage.

Microsoft Teams: Source of meeting recordings.
Teams Bot / Graph API: Retrieves audio data and sends it to the backend.
FastAPI Backend: Core orchestration layer for transcription, summarization, entity/action extraction, and data storage.
Speech-to-Text Module (Vosk, Whisper, etc.): Converts meeting audio into text.
Summarization Module (GPT-4 or fine-tuned BART): Generates concise summaries from transcripts.
Entity & Action Extraction (spaCy or LLM): Extracts names, tasks, deadlines, etc.
Database/Storage: Stores transcripts, summaries, and user-generated metadata.
React Frontend: Presents the data, enabling users to view and manage meeting info.
Detailed Implementation Steps
1. Requirements & Planning
Identify Stakeholders: Who will use or benefit from this tool?
Functional/Non-functional Requirements: Finalize what the system must do and performance/security considerations.
User Flows & Use Cases: Create diagrams or user stories describing how users interact with the system.
Resource Planning: Estimate budgets, tools, and team roles.
Approval & Scope Lock: Finalize the plan with stakeholders.
Outcome: A clear definition of project scope, success metrics, and buy-in from all parties.

2. Architecture & Tech Stack
Architecture: Finalize the microservices or monolithic approach.
Choose Technology:
Backend: Python (FastAPI).
Transcription: Vosk or Whisper for Speech-to-Text.
Summarization: GPT-4 or BART.
Entity Extraction: spaCy or an LLM approach.
Frontend: React.
Containerization: Docker, possibly Docker Compose or Kubernetes.
Data Storage: Decide on a database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.).
Outcome: Approved architecture diagram and final tech stack selection.

3. Environment Setup
Version Control: Initialize a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
Development Environment:
Python virtual environment (venv or conda).
Node.js environment for React.
Install Docker & Docker Compose.
Project Structure:
/backend for FastAPI, speech-to-text, summarization, etc.
/frontend for React.
/docs for documentation.
Outcome: A working base project with structured folders and installed dependencies.

4. Speech-to-Text Module
Vosk Setup:
Install via pip install vosk.
Download a pre-trained English model.
OR Whisper Setup:
Install via pip install openai-whisper.
More accurate but heavier on resources.
Implementation:
Service to handle audio input and return transcript.
Handle long audio (chunking if needed).
Outcome: Automated transcription service ready to be integrated with the backend.

5. Summarization Module
Option 1: GPT-4 API
Use OpenAIâ€™s ChatCompletion API.
Manage prompt construction and chunking for large transcripts.
Option 2: Fine-tuned BART
Use Hugging Face Transformers.
Fine-tune on meeting transcripts for better performance.
Implementation:
Summarization function/service that accepts text and returns summary.
Outcome: Summaries of transcripts in desired formats (paragraphs, bullet points).

6. Entity & Action Item Extraction
spaCy
Use spacy.load("en_core_web_sm") or a custom model.
Extract named entities.
Rule-based or pattern-based approach for action items.
LLM Approach
Prompt GPT-4 with instructions to return structured JSON containing tasks, deadlines, owners.
Implementation:
Endpoint or internal function that returns a list of extracted items.
Outcome: A consistent data format for entities, tasks, and deadlines.
